**Universal Rules:**
You MUST read and apply the coding standards defined in the `ai-specs/AI_RULES.md` file.

**Applying Rules:**
- Read `ai-specs/AI_RULES.md` first to understand the project structure and strict standards.
- Follow the links to specific `.md` files in `ai-specs/base/` and `ai-specs/project/` as needed.

**Always prioritize the standards in `ai-specs/` over general knowledge.**
